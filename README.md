A repo containing the report for the final project of Harvard's CS182 (Artificial Intelligence) using machine learning to predict if low-income households are at risk of meeting loan repayments, a collaborative project with [Cole Bateman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cole-bateman/). CS182 was taught by Professors [Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/people/milind-tambe) and [Boaz Barak](https://quantum.harvard.edu/boaz-barak).

* **CS182 Final Report** is the written element of the project, entitled: *"Lost interest? Using artificial intelligence to predict if low-income households are at risk of meeting loan repayments"*. *(Grade: 50/55)*  :bank:
* **Code** is included in a separate private folder because it is based on work by [Killian, Tambe et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01506).  :computer:
